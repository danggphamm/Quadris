In this project, we tried to build a model to recognize different age ranges of the input face image.
This project was built on KAGGLE. So if you want to reproduce it, please run it on KAGGLE with the added datasets:
"Age recognition dataset" - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/age-recognition-dataset
"Facial age" - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/frabbisw/facial-age

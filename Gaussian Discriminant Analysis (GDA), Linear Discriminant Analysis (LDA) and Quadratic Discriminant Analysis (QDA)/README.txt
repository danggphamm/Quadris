In this project, we will be comparing the performances of
(i) Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA)
(ii) Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
(iii) Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) and
 - approaches for a binary classification problem.
• We will be using 10-fold cross-validation (10 FCV) to measure the classification
Accuracy and Balanced-Accuracy of each fold and the average Accuracy and
average Balanced-Accuracy.
• We will be using a dataset called: ‘Parkinson’s Disease Detection from Voice.’
The dataset was generated by Max Little of the University of Oxford, in
partnership with the National Centre for Voice and Speech, Denver, Colorado,
who recorded the speech signals. The original study published the feature
extraction methods for general voice disorders (for the dataset and the related
publications, see /Moodle/assignment folder).
• Information about the dataset: This dataset consists of a range of biomedical voice
measurements from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Each column in
the table is a particular voice measure, and each row corresponds to one of 195
voice recordings from these individuals. The goal of the processed-data was to
train the model(s) to discriminate healthy people from those with PD.The “class”
column with the value ‘1’ indicates a healthy person, and ‘2’ indicates a person
with PD.

The project is written in MATLAB.
